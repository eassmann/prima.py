Version 0.3 (2015-09-xx):

 * add option --updn to combine spins in one plot

 * read Fermi energy from ‘scf’ rather than ‘scf2’; do not require it
   unless needed

 * change delimiter for combined atoms/orbitals to '++|&' to avoid
   clash with orbital names that contain ‘+’

 * new options --out-suffix, --config-file, --verbose

 * make atoms and orbitals case insensitive

 * colors may be also given in HTML-style hex notation or color names;
   and may be prefixed by a factor, “F × COLOR” for scaling


Version 0.2 (2014-09-01):

 * add support for ‘x qtl’-generated files

 * fix some bugs related to parsing of band character names

 * added option --case

 * add line to postscript for explicit white background
   (current versions of ‘evince’ were drawing black bg)

 * add optimization options in Makefile (can be important even here!)


Version 0.1 (2013-05-31): initial release
